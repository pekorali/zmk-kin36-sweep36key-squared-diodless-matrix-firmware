2. (optional) update keymap and config file
3. wait github action to build the firmware, then you download and decompress the zip file
4. connect left or right half to your computer with use cable
5. left or right half enter bootloader, you can enter bootloader by
   1) double-clicking the reset button
   2) quickly short-circuiting the reset button twice (if the button is not working)
   3) quickly short-circuiting the gnd & rst pins of the controller twice(not the VCC 3.3v or RAW 5v pins!) 
6. copy firmware to your half of keyboard (updating keymap and changing keyboard name do not have to flash the right half)
   1) filename with 'left' is for the left half of keyboard

   3) filename with 'reset' is for the left/right half to forget its bluetooth connection info (when left & right half is not able to connect, to forget paired devices)

- they both have modifier keys =CTRL=, =OPTION (ALT)=, =COMMAND (WINDOWS)= sharing same position with character keys on your ring finger, middle finger and pointing finger on both hands. Hold the key to trigger the modifier, or tap the key to type in character.
